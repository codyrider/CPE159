include = DONE i think? not sure with IO_DELAY.commented section at bottom
type.h = DONE
proc.c = requires 4 functions
        delay DONE
        showchar DONE. Im not sure if i went about it the right way, supposed to use pointer and VID_MASK
        InitProc DONE. again not sure if i should have used pointer and VID_MASK
        UserProc DONE. again not sure if i should have used pointer and VID_MASK


data.h = requires prototypes.
entry.S = probably close :)
lib.c = requires 5 functions
	QisEmpty DONE
	QisFull DONE
	DeQ DONE
	EnQ DONE
	Bzero not sure about functions purpose. zeroize queue by stepping through adr's?	
sr.c = requires 2 functions
main.c = requires all kinds of shit
